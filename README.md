## React + Vite Crush Course Learning Project
While I was learning the course [Get started with React.js & React Router 6+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4baq00tHfmA),I wrote this project.
The course is amazing course,you just need about 6 hours to finish it.
You just have learned javascript and you can learn the course.
The course is based on react-router-dom 2.4,so you can use the latest framework to write your own project with the course help.
The source project of the course is very practical for work use.It have very little errors and warnings,I have fixed it in here.
